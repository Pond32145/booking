# Build Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem
The original build command `tsc --noCheck && vite build` was failing with a "Permission denied" error when trying to execute the TypeScript compiler in deployment environments like Vercel.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by permission restrictions in certain environments (particularly Vercel) where the build process couldn't directly execute the TypeScript compiler binary.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Simplified Build Process
Changed the primary build script to use only Vite's built-in TypeScript handling:
```json
"build": "vite build"
```

### 2. Alternative Build Scripts
Added fallback options for different environments:
```json
"build:types": "tsc --noCheck && vite build",
"build:fallback": "npx tsc --noCheck && vite build",
```

### 3. Permission Fix Script
Created a Node.js script (`fix-permissions.js`) that can fix common permission issues with binaries in the `node_modules/.bin` directory.

### 4. Vercel Build Script
Created a shell script (`vercel-build.sh`) with multiple fallback strategies for Vercel deployments:
- Checks for and installs dependencies if missing
- Runs permission fix script
- Tries multiple build approaches

### 5. Vercel Configuration
Added `vercel.json` configuration to specify the custom build command and proper routing.

## Usage Instructions

### For Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### For Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### For Environments with Permission Issues
```bash
npm run build:fallback
```

### For Vercel Deployments
The vercel.json configuration will automatically use the vercel-build.sh script.

## Why These Changes Work

1. **Vite handles TypeScript**: Vite has built-in support for TypeScript compilation, making the separate tsc step unnecessary for most cases.

2. **npx ensures proper execution**: When tsc is needed, using npx ensures the locally installed version is used correctly.

3. **Multiple fallbacks**: Having several build approaches ensures that if one fails, another can be tried.

4. **Environment-specific handling**: The vercel-build.sh script provides specific handling for Vercel's deployment environment.
