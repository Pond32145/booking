# Build Issue Resolution Summary

## Problem
The original build command `tsc --noCheck && vite build` was failing with a "Permission denied" error when trying to execute the TypeScript compiler in deployment environments like Vercel. We also encountered issues with Vite itself having permission problems, and later discovered that Terser was missing for the minification step.

## Root Cause
The issues were caused by:
1. Permission restrictions in certain environments (particularly Vercel) where the build process couldn't directly execute the build tool binaries.
2. Missing Terser dependency which is required for code minification in production builds.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Updated Build Process
Changed the primary build script to use npx for Vite execution:
```json
"build": "npx vite build"
```

### 2. Alternative Build Scripts
Added multiple fallback options for different environments:
```json
"build:types": "tsc --noCheck && vite build",
"build:fallback": "npx tsc --noCheck && vite build",
"build:direct": "node node_modules/vite/bin/vite.js build",
```

### 3. Enhanced Permission Fix Script
Updated the Node.js script (`fix-permissions.js`) to fix permissions for both TypeScript and Vite binaries.

### 4. Added Missing Dependency
Installed Terser as a dev dependency to resolve the minification issue:
```bash
npm install --save-dev terser
```

### 5. Enhanced Vercel Build Script
Updated `vercel-build.sh` with multiple fallback strategies for Vercel deployments:
- Tries `npx vite build` first
- Falls back to `npm run build:fallback` 
- Finally tries `npm run build:direct` using direct node execution

### 6. Vercel Configuration
Updated `vercel.json` configuration to properly execute the build script.

## Usage Instructions

### For Development
```bash
npm run dev
```

### For Production Build
```bash
npm run build
```

### For Environments with Permission Issues
```bash
npm run build:fallback
```

### For Direct Node Execution
```bash
npm run build:direct
```

### For Vercel Deployments
The vercel.json configuration will automatically use the vercel-build.sh script.

## Why These Changes Work

1. **npx ensures proper execution**: Using npx ensures build tools are executed with proper permissions.

2. **Direct node execution**: As a final fallback, we can execute Vite directly through node, bypassing shell script execution entirely.

3. **Multiple fallbacks**: Having several build approaches ensures that if one fails, another can be tried.

4. **Enhanced permission handling**: The fix-permissions script now handles both TypeScript and Vite binaries.

5. **Complete dependency set**: Installing Terser resolves the minification issue that would cause build failures.

6. **Environment-specific handling**: The vercel-build.sh script provides specific handling for Vercel's deployment environment with multiple fallback strategies.
