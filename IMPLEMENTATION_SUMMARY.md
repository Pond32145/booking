# Implementation Summary: Replacing Mock Data with Real Backend

## Overview

This implementation replaces the mock data system with a real backend service using Node.js, Express, TypeScript, and SQLite. The frontend now fetches data from the backend API instead of using local JSON files.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created New Backend Service

- **Directory**: `backend/`
- **Technology Stack**:
  - Node.js with TypeScript
  - Express.js for RESTful API
  - SQLite for development database
  - Sequelize ORM for database operations

### 2. Backend Features

- **Models**: Venue, Service, Booking, Category entities with proper relationships
- **Routes**: RESTful endpoints for all entities
- **Database**: Seeding script to populate with existing mock data
- **Environment Configuration**: Using dotenv for configuration

### 3. Updated Frontend API Service

- **File**: `src/shared/data/api.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Replaced mock data fetching with real HTTP requests
  - Added proper error handling
  - Updated all API functions to use backend endpoints
  - Maintained same interface for compatibility

### 4. Data Migration

- All existing mock data from JSON files has been migrated to the SQLite database
- No data loss during the migration process
- Same data structure maintained for frontend compatibility

## How to Run the Complete System

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)

### Starting the Backend

```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed
npm run dev
```

The backend will start on http://localhost:3001

### Starting the Frontend

```bash
# In a new terminal, from the root directory
npm install
npm run dev
```

The frontend will start on http://localhost:5173

### Accessing the Application

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173

## API Endpoints

### Health Check
- `GET /api/health` - System health status

### Venues
- `GET /api/venues` - Get all venues
- `GET /api/venues/:id` - Get a specific venue

### Services
- `GET /api/services` - Get all services
- `GET /api/services/:id` - Get a specific service

### Bookings
- `GET /api/bookings` - Get all bookings
- `GET /api/bookings/:id` - Get a specific booking
- `POST /api/bookings/:id/cancel` - Cancel a booking

### Categories
- `GET /api/categories` - Get all categories

## Benefits of This Implementation

1. **Real Data Persistence**: Data is now stored in a database instead of memory
2. **Scalability**: Can easily add more features and data without modifying frontend logic
3. **Production Ready**: Structure can be easily adapted for production with PostgreSQL
4. **Separation of Concerns**: Clear separation between frontend and backend
5. **Maintainability**: Easier to maintain and extend with proper MVC structure
6. **Performance**: Database queries are more efficient than loading JSON files

## Future Improvements

1. Add authentication and authorization
2. Implement data validation and sanitization
3. Add pagination for large datasets
4. Implement caching for better performance
5. Add unit and integration tests
6. Add logging and monitoring
7. Implement data backup and recovery procedures

## Compatibility

The implementation maintains full compatibility with the existing frontend code. No changes were required in the React components as the API interface remains the same.
